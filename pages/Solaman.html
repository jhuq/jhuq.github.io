        <h1>Solaman/Sasha</h1>
        <h3>Pakistsan Wedding Events</h3>
        <p class="p-left">
            Solaman married a few years ago in Pakistan. <br>Both events are culturally and traditionally influenced. To
            understand the importance, it is best to understand the Pakistani culture. Marriage is not only considered a
            union between husband and wife, but also a union between their families. <br>
            <br>A Pakistani wedding consists of different events combined in week-long celebrations. However, in Solaman
            and Sasha case, the Walima and Rukhsati events were held the following year.
            Let me walk you through traditions as they pertain to Solaman and Sasha's wedding and you can decide for
            yourself how colorful these events can be.

            <img src="../images/mehndi.jpg" alt="Mehdi" id="mehdi">
            <p class="p-left">The Mehndi ceremony is held the night before the Nikah as a way of wishing good health and
                success as they make their journey on to the marriage. The Mehndi event was for close family members and
                friends. <br>This was the first main function of the wedding where the bride gets her hand hennaed with
                a beautiful mehndi design. It was just a fun night of dance and music. The girls perform dances that
                they
                spend weeks preparing. There was a henna artist who applied Mehndi to our hands during the event. <br>
                <br> Sasha is wearing a traditional orange salwar kami dress. There are no set style requirements,
                however,
                wearing bright colors such as yellow or orange is common for the Mendi event.<br>
                <br>
                The décor of the mehndi is orange fresh flowers; Sasha and Solaman are wearing fresh flowers as
                ornaments. The
                variety
                of food at the mehndi event was barbecue, biryani, and lots of other food items that everyone enjoyed.

            <p class="p-left"> The Nikah is the formal marriage ceremony where a marriage contract is signed by both the
                bride and the groom in the presence of close family members. The Nikah is typically performed by a
                religious scholar at a mosque, who is licensed by the government to perform the ceremony. <br>
                <br>The Nikah was a small intimate event that involves just families and close friends to celebrate the
                marriage of the
                bride and groom.
                The dresses of Nikah are usually of pastel colors, Sasha is wearing gray with a white dupatta. Solaman
                is wearing a white salwa kurta. <br>
                <br> Here is Solaman with his new brother-in-law.

                <br>
                Our family greeted guests by throwing roses over their heads. Our family also present
                garland to the bride's Mother and Father which is worn around the necks. When Solaman and Sasha
                arrived,
                Sidra my youngest
                daughter was given the basket of roses to throw at the bride and groom. But rather than throwing
                over
                their head she being
                mischievous, took handfuls and threw right at her brother getting flower peddles in his hair.
