        <p>I fear the darkness with its hidden panels of illusions and myths.</p>
        <p id="textarea" style="display: none">But I also love the darkness;
            I find my time to break down and imagine.<br>
            <br>The practical of the day becomes the peculiar of the night.<br>
            Everything takes on a new cover.<br>
            My mirror becomes hidden words.<br>
            My eyes become magnets of shadows and every noise becomes cries of those shadows.<br>
            <br> I surround myself in darkness and throw away the adulthood of too much knowledge.<br>
            I laugh and dance and sing in unreal and play hide and seek with reality.<br>
            <br> In my games, I wonder, what is real?<br>
            <br> Do our eyes tell us lies of make-believe in the too much brightness of day?<br>
            <br> Do we see the realness of the word when darkness comes to rest our eyes from the light?<br>
            <br> Or are we completely fooled by day and night and we are our own illusions?<br>
            <br> I fear the darkness and I fear my love for it.<br>
            <br> But I would not give it up.<br>
            I find my laughter and my life in these empty spaces of time.</p>

            <br> It was precious to me, more than anything I possessed.<br>
            It made me laugh, cry, feel and believe again in fairy tales.<br>

            Taunt the silence in the crowd.<br>

            <br>The nightingale with sadden eyes cried in his sorrow and lifted his voice to speak.<br>
            “I have seen the world twice, lifted my cup with the noblest of men and, loved with the loveliest of nature.
            In all this, I did not sense I was real.<br>

            <br> Finding your real self takes more than experience, sharing, words, or laughter. It takes hard
            bitter times and the weeping of tears.
            <br> It took the trapping of a star and the caging of a man for me to know what is real.<br>

            <br>In my youth, I have done almost everything and now I know love is real.
            <br> When you deny love was once inside you, you deny the realness of your soul.”<br>

            <br>Then the nightingale shivered in the cold, gave one last moan, and died.
